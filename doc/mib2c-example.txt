writing to -
mib2c has multiple configuration files depending on the type of
code you need to write.  You must pick one depending on your need.

You requested mib2c to be run on the following part of the MIB tree:
  OID:                       	    nfctd
  numeric translation:       	    .1.3.6.1.4.1.18141.1.1.1.5
  number of scalars within:         0
  number of tables within:          1
  number of notifications within:   0

First, do you want to generate code that is compatible with the
ucd-snmp 4.X line of code, or code for the newer Net-SNMP 5.X code
base (which provides a much greater choice of APIs to pick from):

  1) ucd-snmp style code
  2) Net-SNMP style code

		     GENERATING CODE FOR TABLES:
**********************************************************************

  The Net-SNMP agent API is extremely extensive and, in fact, lets
  each programmer write agent code according to the style that works
  best for them based on their experience and their preference.  We're
  going to ask you a serious of questions that will help mib2c
  generate code that best suits *your* needs, as the programmer that
  will be responsible for taking the code and further refining it.  If
  you don't like how the results look, you are always welcome to
  re-run mib2c and select a different set of options.

    There are essentially two tasks involved in processing requests
  for OIDs within a MIB table - firstly identifying the relevant row
  of the table for a given request, and then returning (or updating)
  the appropriate column value within that row.  Many MIB tables model
  the state of some external system (the kernel, a device, processes,
  etc), and the MIB implementation module (the code we're about to
  produce a template for) acts as an interface between this underlying
  system and the SNMP side.  Other tables hold data internally that is
  only available within the agent itself, or at least the master copy
  of the data is held within the agent.

    There are a number of different code templates that can be used to
  implement MIB tables, using various approaches to these two tasks.

  There are three basic approaches to identifying the relevant row:

    1) Pass the request through to the table-specific code, and
       identify the requested row there (for both GET and GETNEXT
       requests).  This is typically the most efficient way to get
       up-to-date information, but relies on suitable
       (programmer-provided) code within the MIB handler.
       Most importantly, you should be an expert to use this choice.

       This will produce code based on the table_dataset handler.

    2) Have table-specific code to provide information about which
       rows exist in the table (by iterating through them in turn),
       but utilise standard helper code to select the appropriate
       row for a given request.  This is particularly suitable for
       tables where the data is naturally stored in a "random" order
       (or differently to the MIB table index), or where rows are
       frequently added to or removed from the table.

         However searching for the requested row is not very efficient,
       and performance can be slow - particularly for large tables with
       many rows.

    3) Hold a locally cached copy of the contents of the table (or at
       least a cache of which rows are valid), and utilise standard
       helper code to select the appropriate row.  This is
       significantly faster than the iterator-based approach, but
       cached data is inevitably slightly "stale" with respect to the
       data from the underlying system being managed.  This approach,
       since it relies on caching of data, is also results in a larger
       memory footprint.  It is less appropriate for tables where rows
       are frequently added or removed externally to the agent (i.e.,
       not via SNMP requests).

       This approach can also be used where _all_ use of the table is
       via SNMP, and there is no external "underlying system".  In
       this case, the local cache is the canonical version of the
       table.

    4) Do not generate code for the tables.

Select the option that best fits your requirements: 2


  Having identified the appropriate row for a given request, there are
  three basic styles of code for returning (or updating) the requested
  column value from within this row:

    1) A single handler routine, which contains all the code needed to
       handle GET and SET requests for each of the column objects.

       The code typically looks like a single function with a large 'case'
       statement covering each of the columns.

       This will produce code based on the 'iterator' hepler.

    2) A set of individual routines, each of which is concerned
       with a particular aspect of processing the request.
       Each column object within the table has one routine for
       retrieving the current value, and another for setting a new one.

       This will produce code based on the 'iterate_access' hepler.

    3) A (different) set of individual routines, each of which is
       smaller and more tightly focused than the code generated by
       style 2.  The aim here is to reduce the amount of SNMP specific
       knowledge required to implement a module, and hide much of the
       SNMP terminology and processing within standard generated code
       (which can simply be used sight unseen).
         However this style of code can only be generated when mib2c
       is run on an individual MIB table.  To use this approach, you
       will need to re-invoke mib2c with the name of a single MIB table.

       This will produce code based on the 'mfd' hepler ('MIB for Dummies').

    4) Do not generate code for the tables.

   (In all cases, GETNEXT requests are automatically converted
    into the equivalent GET request, so the MIB specific code
    need only be concerned with GET and SET requests.).

     The same template code can be generated using
                 mib2c -c mib2c.iterate.conf nfctd
This framework can work in one of two ways:

  1)  Hold a local cached copy of some external data
      which is then used to service incoming requests.

  2)  Query the external data directly for each request.

The first is typically more efficient, but results in
slightly "stale" data (depending on the expiration timeout
for the cache) and greater memory usage.  The second can
provide more up-to-date information, but at the cost of
higher processing overheads.
